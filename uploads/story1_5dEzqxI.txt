The rain hammered against the windowpane, mirroring the relentless drumming inside Priya's head. She'd been so busy with work, she hadn't realized how much she'd missed the simple things. Then, a knock. Not the neighbor's usual polite tap, but a forceful, insistent pounding.
Priya, heart racing, cautiously opened the door. Standing there, soaked and shivering, was her childhood friend, Raj, looking older, worn, and somehow...different. The years had etched lines of hardship on his face, yet his eyes held a familiar spark of mischief. He didn't speak, just stood there, a silent question in his gaze. 
Priya, momentarily speechless, felt a pang of something she couldn't quite name â€“ perhaps regret, perhaps a quiet understanding. The rain continued to fall, and the room seemed to shrink, encompassing just the two of them, their shared history hanging heavy in the air. She knew, in that moment, their lives had taken different paths, but the unexpected guest had brought with him a reminder of a connection that time and circumstance couldn't quite erase.
